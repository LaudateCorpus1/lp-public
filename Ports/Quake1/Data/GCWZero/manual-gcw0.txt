Thenesis Quake v1.0 for GCW-Zero 

This version is based on Quake v1.09 and GLQuake v1.0.

You can put the data either in the internal or external SD card.
Do not copy any .cfg file ! It may cause trouble.

- For the internal SD card, put the data files in this path:
  /media/data/Quake
  This directory is searched wherever you put the OPK.
- For the external SD card, you cannot use the OPK.
  You must use the binary files directly and put them on the SD card along with the data in
  /Quake

Copy only the .pak files in their associated directory:
- For original game, copy files in "id1" subdirectory.
- For "Dissolution of Eternity mission pack", copy files in "rogue" subdirectory.
- For "Scourge of Armagon mission pack", copy files in "hipnotic" subdirectory.

With all mission packs you should have the following files:
Quake/id1/pak0.pak
Quake/id1/pak1.pak
Quake/hipnotic/pak0.pak
Quake/rogue/pak0.pak

Ensure that all pak file names are lower case !

You can also use the demo version of Quake.
In this case you have only one pak file:
Quake/id1/pak0.pak

There is some hardwired cheat keys which are enabled when the power switch is on the lock position:
- START: Enable cheats when creating a server.
- LEFT: No target.
- RIGHT: Give all weapons, ammos and items.
- DOWN: Enable / disable no clipping mode.
- UP: Enable / disable god mode.
- LEFT TRIGGER: Enable / disable draw world.
- RIGHT TRIGGER: Enable / disable light maps.
